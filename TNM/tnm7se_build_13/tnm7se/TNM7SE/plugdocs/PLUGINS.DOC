  As you likely know, one of TNM 7's new killer features is its ability
  to incorporate plugins into the mix.

  This is a new experience for all of us - you as the developers who want
  to see their programs work with TNM 7 and me, the person having to write
  the plugin interface as a whole and the accompanying documentation.

  There's one thing I want to clear up before we get started: TNM 7's
  Plugin Interface is far from being static. It will certainly be changed
  over the weeks and months to come.

  At the moment, all plugins are invoked by opening a special menu and
  selecting a plugin. My goal is to eventually allow for plugins to create
  new match types which integrate into TNM 7 like the built-in matches do.

  Mike Sweetser, for instance, is currently working on a Brawl For All
  plugin. As of this writing, when invoking the plugin, you need to enter
  the names of the two wrestlers you want to pit against one another.

  Eventually, I see the "Brawl For All" match being an option on the match
  scheduling screen - which means the plugin will be "fed" its data in a form
  where no additional user interaction is necessary for the match to begin.

 º±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  Where We Are  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±º
 ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

  The current Plugin Interface version is 1.1.

  TNM 7 is organized in the following way:

    * PROGRAM:  contains all program files
    * DATA:     contains all data files
    * PLUGINS:  contains all plugin .INF-files and the directories which
                host the actual plugin programs

  In addition, TNM 7 has a directory for every existing circuit.

  There are two different types of plugins, regular plugins and so-called
  "circuit plugins".

  The main differences are their purpose and the place where they are
  executed. A circuit plugin usually performs an action which is sensible
  at circuit-level only, e.g. a logfile formatter. Running such a plugin
  outside of a circuit makes no sense. The opposite is true for regular
  plugins. What would the purpose of running the TNM 7 Diagnostics Utility
  in a circuit directory be ?

  When TNM 7 is started up, it's running in the TNM 7 root directory, i.e.
  the directory containing the PROGRAM, DATA and PLUGINS directories.

  This is the same environment in which regular plugins run. Of TNM 7's
  program code, only the main progam and the TNM ControlCenter run in this
  environment.

  Once you switch over to a circuit, TNM 7 starts running in the circuit's
  directory (e.g. C:\TNM7\WWF). While this doesn't sound like a biggie, it
  is. As soon as you move away from TNM 7's root directory, all file
  locations change.

  For instance, before entering a circuit, the wrestler database could be
  accessed by opening DATA\WRESTLRS.DAT (more info on this later). Once you're
  in a circuit, the path is ..\DATA\WRESTLRS.DAT.

  The same goes for every other file. While a circuit plugin has to access
  TNM 7's configuration file by opening ..\TNM.CNF, a regular plugin will
  find it by opening TNM.CNF.

  You have to make up your mind concerning what kind of plugin you want to
  write *before* coding the first line. The first step *always* is to
  decide what kind of a plugin to make.

  Will you plugin be more useful as a general tool or rather on a circuit
  level ?

  Once that decision has been made, you can start coding.

  Some examples for accessing files as a regular plugin or as a circuit
  plugin:

  All plugins are called in a uniform way by TNM 7's Plugin Interface 1.1:

    plugin_executable plugin_program_directory plugin_data_directory

  Example (circuit plugin named PLUGTEST.EXE):

    ..\PLUGINS\PLUGTEST\PLUGTEST.EXE C:\TNM7\PLUGINS\PLUGTEST C:\TNM7\PLUGINS\PLUGTEST\DATA

  That means your program will be passed two parameters via the command
  line:

  a) its program directory
     -> you need this to access any resource files your program comes with,
        for instance bitmaps and compile-time data files
     -> to access these files, you simply need to take the resource's
        location relative to your program file (e.g. BITMAPS\BITMAP1.BMP)
        and append it to the program directory passed through the command
        line (don't forget to put a "\" between the parts !), giving you
        C:\TNM7\PLUGINS\PLUGTEST\BITMAPS\BITMAP1.BMP - which is the location
        where your resource will be found
     -> under no circumstances should you hardcode any paths into your
        program; always use the plugin_program_directory variable and the
        relative location of your resource !
  b) its data directory
     -> this is the ONLY place your plugin is allowed to write its data to !
     -> it is your job to make sure the data directory exists before writing
        files to it; create it if it doesn't exist

  There are certain restrictions that we place on you, the plugin developers.
  Exceptions from these restrictions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.

  1. Your plugins must not write data anywhere but in the directory passed
     via the command line. In particular, we absolutely forbid write access
     to any of TNM 7's data files. Exceptions may be granted if you really
     know what you're doing. Ask first, though.
  2. Your plugins must clear the screen on exit.
  3. In order to turn your programs into true plugins, you need to send them
     to copp@tnm7.com. You will then receive an authorization file for each
     of them (*.INF). TNM 7 will not accept your programs as plugins without
     those files.

  In addition to these restrictions, there are certain recommendations we
  make:

  1. All text-mode plugins should display a center-aligned copyright notice
     in the last line of the screen, white (color 15) on dark red (color 4).
  2. If your plugin creates any temporary files, always delete them before
     exiting.
  3. If necessary, add some kind of documentation to your plugin and make it
     accessible from the program.

  You are not limited in any way when it comes to the programming language
  you want to use. TNM 7 allows you to create your plugins in any language
  which can generate EXE-files.

  QBASIC won't do because its files come as source code. Source code files
  can not be used as TNM 7 plugins !

    Additional Information:
      One record consists of three lines, the two shown above and an
      empty line; this empty line has to be there although it isn't used
      anymore. It used to host the logo to be shown when entering the
      circuit. This feature was cut when TNM V6.0 was released since it
      only worked in DOS and fullscreen Windows.


  2. TNM.BUI:
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
    Purpose:
      Contains the names and locations of all your backups

    Structure:

      WarGamesPeriodOne=300
      WarGamesPeriodOther=120

    Additional Information:
      You can also store options specific to your plugin in this file.
      However, we recommend using a configuration file of your own to allow
      the user to uninstall plugins without a trace. If you're writing a
      circuit plugin, the file can be found at ..\TNM.CNF. For regular
      plugins, it's at TNM.CNF.
      

  4. DIVES.DAT:

    Additional Information:
      Each record consists of 120 lines of which 90 are used at this point.
      Use the database browser for more detailed information on how
      exactly wrestler records look and how they are to be interpreted.

      All moves and counters referenced here are move numbers. All dives are
      dive numbers. All managers are manager numbers.


  14. *.IDX:
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
    Purpose:
      Index files which allow for quicker random access to the various
      databases.

    Structure:
      file position where record 1 starts
      file position where record 2 starts
      file position where record 3 starts
      ...
      file position where second-to-last record starts
      file position where last record starts

    Additional Information:
      All indexes start at a base of 0, i.e. when you open a file for random
      access, its position is assumed as zero. This is true for many
      programming languages. However, if the one you are using uses a base
      of 1, you need to add 1 to all index values to get the correct starting
      position.

      The wrestler database, for instance, is pushing 600k at the time this
      is being written. If you wish to access wrestler 845 of 846, you should
      definitely not read all 844 records before his comes. Since all
      wrestler records consist of 120 lines, you'd be reading a total of
      101,401 lines of data before you've retrieved the wrestler record you
      need.

      Obviously, this is far too slow. This is where the index files come in
      handy. Instead of going through the 844 records before the record you
      need, you simply open the index file first, go through the 844 record
      starting positions you need and retrieve the position where your record
      starts. Then you close the index file (if you don't need it anymore) and
      open the database you actually need. Do a SEEK to the record position
      you retrieved from the index file and then you can immediately start
      reading the data of the record you want and need - and nothing else.

      This brings down the number of lines you have to read from 101,401 to
      965 - which means your code will work over 100 times faster !

      Take my advice and use the index files whenever possible. You won't
      regret it.

    Example:
      Let's assume you have a small wrestler database with only four
      wrestlers.

      The 120-line record for the first wrestler, Jimmy Snuka, will start at
      file position 5 (let's not forget that the first line in the file
      contains the number of wrestlers, hence the first record can't start at
      position 0). Let's also assume that all wrestler records are 600 bytes
      long - which is a fairly accurate number for most.

      This means that Rey Misterio Jr.'s record will start at position 605,
      The Warlord starts at position 1205 and Bill Goldberg is last starting
      at position 1805.

      Your WRESTLRS.DAT file looks like this:
            4
            Jimmy Snuka
            <119 other lines of data>
            Rey Misterio Jr.
            <119 other lines of data>
            The Warlord
            <119 other lines of data>
            Bill Goldberg
            <119 other lines of data>

      The index file, WRESTLRS.IDX, will have the following structure in
      this example:
            5
            605
            1205
            1805

    Step-By-Step Instructions On Using Indexes:
      0) your goal is to access record x in the data file
      1) open index file
      2) read x lines of data from the index file; the x-th line of data is
         the starting position of record x in the database; we'll call it
         start_pos
      3) close the index file
      4) open the data file
      5) seek to position start_pos in the data file
      6) the file will not be at the position where record x starts
      7) read record
      8) close data file

      Obviously, if you need to access multiple wrestlers out-of-order, it
      is a good idea to read the contents of the index file into an array in
      memory and keep referencing that instead of opening the index file
      each and every time you need to access something.

    Sample Implementation In BASIC:

      function seekRecord&(byval database$,byval recordnumber)
      ' database$ is the base file name for a database, e.g. WRESTLRS,
      ' MOVES, MANAGERS, STABLES etc
      ' recordnumber is the number of the record you wish to access
      '
      ' seekRecord& returns an open file number which points to the
      ' start of the record you wish to access
      '
            f=freefile
            open database$+".idx" for input as#f
            g=freefile
            open database$+".dat" for input as#g
            input#g,nrofrecords
            if recordnumber>nrofrecords then
                  close#g
                  close#f
                  function=-1 ' return no pointer if the number of available
                              ' records is smaller than the record you want
                              ' to retrieve
            end function
            for a=1 to recordnumber
                  input#f,index
            next
            close#f
            seek#g,index
            function=g
      end function

    Sample Code For Using seekRecord&():
      deflng a-z
      database$="WRESTLRS" ' use wrestler database
      do
            input "What record number do you want to access ? ",r
            if r=0 then exit do
            f=seekRecord(database$,r)     ' open database and go to right
                                          ' position
            if f=-1 then                  ' record didn't exist
                  print "Sorry... record doesn't exist."
            else
                  line input#f,x$
                  print "First line of record is: "x$
            end if
            close#f                       ' close database
      loop

      recent opponent(s) 4
            
    Additional Information:
      TNM 7 updates this file at runtime. If a wrestler fights somebody
      new, this new opponent will move to the top of the list and the others
      move one notch down. If the wrestler fights somebody who already is in
      his list of recent opponents, this opponent will move back up to 1
      with the others adjusting accordingly.


  21. CARD.INF:
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

      number of months wrestler will remain out of action
      ...
      number of injured wrestler or injured wrestler's name
      number of months wrestler will remain out of action

    Additional Information:
      When a wrestler is injured, his name is placed in this file along
      with the number of months he'll be out. Later on, TNM 7 transforms
      the wrestler's name into his number so don't be surprised if you only
      see numbers here with one name interspersed and the name then
      suddenly disappears.


  23. CARD.LOL:
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
    Purpose:
      Contains the number of cards in the circuit which were migrated from
      TNM V6.xx.

    Structure:
      oldnr = number of cards done in TNM V6.xx

    Additional Information:
      During the TNM 7 updating routine, a user's circuits will be
      transferred to TNM 7. TNM 7's title handler is infinitely more
      powerful than TNM V6.xx's title handler. As a consequence, there is
      no way of converting TNM V6.2 cards into TNM 7 cards. However, TNM 7
      provides legacy support for the old title handler so that title changes
      occurring in the first oldnr cards will also be recognized when
      browsing the card results. TNM 7 uses CARD.LOL to know where the switch
      from TNM V6.xx to TNM 7 took place.


  24. CARD.OVV:

      title name n
      title flag n

    Additional Information:
      The flag is 1 for a singles title, 2 for a tag title and so on. The
      maximum is 5 for a ten-man tag title.

   As has been indicated already, this is not the end of the road. The
   Plugin Interface will improve constantly as long as there is demand
   for it to improve.

   For instance, I will be adding a registration scheme which plugin
   authors can use to sell their plugins to users. It'll take care of
   generating registration codes and validating them - a quite touchy
   subject if you're not doing it completely professionally.

   To this day, there is no key generator for TNM V6.2plus or TNM 7 and
   for good reason: the algorithms used for generation and validation are
   completely waterproof.

   Obviously, a long time was spent and a lot of know-how was invested into
   developing them.

   Thus far, TNM 7's Plugin Interface does not allow for commercial plugins.

   One of the next releases of the Interface will contain code to handle
   just that.

   What is the point I'm trying to make ?

   TNM 7 will contain a version file in the future where it notes which
   version of the Plugin Interface is installed.

   This file will reside in DATA\PLGCVERS.DAT and you, as a plugin developer,
   should equip the plugins you are writing *today* to support version
   control.

   I recommend checking if DATA\PLGCVERS.DAT (..\DATA\PLGCVERS.DAT for a
   circuit plugin) exists. If not, it's safe to say that the Interface
   version is 1.1 or lower.

   If it does exist, open the file and read the one and only line in it
   which'll be a floating point number (e.g. 1.2). If your plugin was
   written for a later version of the Plugin Connector, then display a
   message that it won't run and quit immediately.

   For instance, if you write a commercial plugin and want to use TNM 7's
   registration scheme for it, and TNM 7 only starts supporting commercial
   plugins with Interface version 2.1, then check the PLGCVERS.DAT file
   to come up with the installed version.

   If you find out that the installed version doesn't yet support commercial
   plugins, exit gracefully to protect your property.

   Again, please let me stress that it is *your* responsibility to make sure
   your plugins know when to exit in order to not ruin anything.
 
   A second thing which I want to add eventually is support for new match
   types like the Brawl For All plugin Mike Sweetser currently is working
   on. They'll only be a hit if they integrate into TNM 7 seamlessly. We
   can't expect the user to enter the wrestlers' names manually.

   There are certain mountains which I'll have to climb before this feature
   can be implemented but it is possible and you can rest assured it will
   not be forgotten.

    This ends version 1.0 of the Plugin Creators' manual.

    I'm sure I've left out some vital information here or there and I'd
    be awfully grateful if anybody pointed out something they don't
    understand so I can gradually improve this manual.

    Thanks for reading and happy programming !
